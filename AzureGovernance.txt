Azure Governance
- Azure Blueprints
    + Azure Blueprints help standardize cloud subscription ro environments deployment
    + it can define repeatable settings and policies that are appleid as new subscritions are created
    + Blueprints deploy a new environment based on all of the requirements, settings, and configuraitons
      of the associated artifacts. Artifacts can include things like:
        - Role assignments
        - Policy assignments
        - Resource groups
        - Azure resource manager templates
        - the relationships between resource defintions and assignments (what is deployed) is preserved, which is very useful for backtracking to older versions for lagacy deployment and error correction.     

- Azure Policy
    + Enables you to create, assing, and manage policies that control or audit your resources. 
    + Helps define individual policies and groups of related policies, that are known as initiatives, which helps keep the resources polcy compliant with regulatory and corporate standards. 
    
- Azure resource locks
    + Prevents resources from being accidentally deleted or changed. 
    + There are two types of resource locks: 
        - Delete: authorized users can still read and modify a resosurce, but they cannot delete the resource
        - ReadOnly: authorized users can read, but they cannot delete or update the resource. Applying lock is similar to restricting all authorized users to the permissions granted by the Reader role

- Azure Service trust portal 
    + portal that provides access to various content tools, and othe resource about microsoft security privacy and compliance practices. 



Azure Arc
- Manage your entire environment together by projecting your existing non-Azure resources into ARM.
- Manage multi-cloud and hybrid virtual machines, Kubernetes clusters, and databases as if they are running in Azure.
- Use familiar Azure services and management capabilities, regardless of where they live.
- Continue using traditional ITOps while introducing DevOps practices to support new cloud and native patterns in your environment.
- Configure custom locations as an abstraction layer on top of Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters and cluster extensions.

- What can Azure Arc do outside of Azure?
    + Currently, Azure Arc allows you to manage the following resource types hosted outside of Azure:
        Servers
        Kubernetes clusters
        Azure data services
        SQL Server
        Virtual machines (preview)


- Resource organization
    + Resource Group: for grouping related resources 
    + Resouce Tags: for demystyfing resources, giving context to the created resources
        - They store metadata that is useful for:
            + Resource management 
            + cost management and optimization
            + security 
            + Governance and regulatory compliance
            + workload optimizaiton and automation
            
    + Rosource Locks: help to avoid accidental changes and delections. 

- Azure Advisor evaluates your Azure resources and make recommendations to help improve in the following areas:
    + reliability
    + security 
    + performance
    + operational excellence 
    + Cost
